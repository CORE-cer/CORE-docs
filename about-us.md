# About us

## CORE developer team

**CORE** is a complex event recognition engine currently being developed by **Kyle Bossonney**, **Nicolás Buzeta**, **Vicente Calisto**, **Juan-Eduardo López**, and professor [**Cristian Riveros**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wkDO2HIAAAAJ) of the [Millenium Institute Foundational Research on Data](https://imfd.cl/en/) and the [School of Engineering of the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile](https://www.ing.uc.cl/en/), and professor [**Stijn Vansummeren**](https://www.uhasselt.be/en/who-is-who/stijn-vansummeren) of the [University of Hasselt](https://www.uhasselt.be/en). We thank **Marco Bucchi**, **Matías Correa**, **Alejandro Grez**, **Andrés Quintana**, and **Ignacio Villanueva**, for collaborating on of this project.
